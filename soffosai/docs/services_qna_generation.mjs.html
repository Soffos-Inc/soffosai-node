/**
 * The Q&amp;A Generation module splits large documents in chunks from which it generates multiple 
 * question-answer pairs. The chunk length is configurable. Usually more questions can be generated
 * when segmenting the text to smaller chunks, while longer chunks help retain more context, in cases 
 * where a topic is discussed over multiple sentences in the context. To address cases where the topic 
 * is split mid-way, the module supports overlapping the chunks by a configurable amount of sentences. 
 * This gives a lot of flexibility to cater to your specific use case.

     * @param {boolean} [sentence_overlap=false] - Whether to overlap adjacent chunks by 1 sentence.
     * For example, with sentence_split 3 and sentence_overlap=true :
