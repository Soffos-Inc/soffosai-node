/**
 * The Q&A Generation module splits large documents in chunks from which it generates multiple 
 * question-answer pairs. The chunk length is configurable. Usually more questions can be generated
 * when segmenting the text to smaller chunks, while longer chunks help retain more context, in cases 
 * where a topic is discussed over multiple sentences in the context. To address cases where the topic 
 * is split mid-way, the module supports overlapping the chunks by a configurable amount of sentences. 
 * This gives a lot of flexibility to cater to your specific use case.

     * @param {string} user - The ID of the user accessing the Soffos API.  Soffos assumes that the owner of

     * @param {number} [sentence_split=3] - The number of sentences of each chunk when splitting the input text.
     * @param {boolean} [sentence_overlap=false] - Whether to overlap adjacent chunks by 1 sentence.
     * For example, with sentence_split 3 and sentence_overlap=true :

     * chunks - dictionary list <br>
     * A list of dictionaries representing the chunks as they were split from the original according to the splitting parameters given in the request. Each dictionary contains the fields text, index as well as the span_start and span_end fields which are the starting and ending position of the chunk in the originally provided text.
