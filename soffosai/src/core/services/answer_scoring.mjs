/** 
 * This module will mark the user's answer based on the provided context, the question and, 
 * optionally, the expected correct answer. Typical string similarity methods often fail to accurately 
 * capture the similarity in meaning and semantics, especially in cases where a single word can alter 
 * the entire meaning of a sentence. This module not only addresses this issue, but the fact that the 
 * underlying AI understands the context and question also enables it to evaluate an answer even if 
 * the expected correct answer is not provided. However, when provided, the evaluation will give it 
 * more weight than the information in the context.

 * The score is a value between 0 and 1, with 0 being completely wrong and 1 being perfectly accurate. 
 * Additionally, the reasoning behind the score is provided.

 * The Answer Scoring module is a perfect fit to supplement the Q&A generation module by marking 
 * users' answers to AI-generated question-answer pairs. Together they can power a wide range of 
 * educational and retention-assessment applications.
