/**
 * The summarization module utilizes Natural Language Generation (NLG) to generate an 
 * abstractive summary of a specified length. In contrast to extractive summarization methods, 
 * which simply calculate the centrality of sentences or passages in the original text and 
 * concatenate the highest rated ones, abstractive summaries are often more concise and accurate. 
 * The end result isn't necessarily a sum of word-for-word copies of passages from the original text, 
 * but a combination of all key points formulated as a new text.
