- You can also save your API Key into your environment variables with variable name = SOFFOSAI_API_KEY
- To set your API key:
    When you initialize a service, include it on key word arguments:
    ```
    import { SoffosServices } from "soffosai-node";

    let service = new SoffosServices.AmbiguityDetectionService({apiKey: my_apiKey});
    ```
    OR set your API key globally:
    ```
    import { SoffosServices, SoffosConfig } from "soffosai";

    SoffosConfig.apiKey = "<your API key>";
    let service = new SoffosServices.AmbiguityDetectionService();
    ```

// Import the Soffos Service you need
import { SoffosServices } from "soffosai-node";

//Instantiate the SoffosAIService that you need:
let service = new SoffosServices.TagGenerationService({apiKey: my_apiKey});

// if you set your environment variables no need to put keyword argument apiKey:
// let service = new SoffosServices.TagGenerationService();

//Call the service and print the output:
let response = await service.call(
    "client_id",
    "The Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first installment in The Matrix film series...",
    undefined, 5
)
console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
```

## Pipeline
- A Soffos Pipeline is a series of Soffos Services working together.
In order to create a Pipeline, a service should call .setInputConfig then supply it to the pipeline's constructor:
```
import { SoffosPipeline, SoffosServices, SoffosConfig } from "soffosai";

SoffosConfig.apiKey = "<api key>";
const file_converter = new SoffosServices.FileConverterService();
file_converter.setInputConfigs(
    "file_converter",
    new InputConfig("user_input", "file"), // get the value of "file" property of the user input.
    new InputConfig("user_input", "normalize") // get the value of "normalize" property of the user input.
);

const document_ingest = new SoffosServices.DocumentsIngestService();
document_ingest.setInputConfigs(
    "doc_ingest",
    new InputConfig("user_input", "file", get_filename),
    new InputConfig("file_converter", "text") // get the ouput of the service named "fileconverter", get "text" property of it.
);
const services = [file_converter, ingestor];
const pipe = new SoffosPipeline(services, false, "my_pipeline");
```
This newly created Pipeline named "pipe" will then upload a file to soffos and extract its text content then save it as a document. The required input is clearly stated in the setInputConfigs because it has "user_input" in them. Thus to run this Pipeline:
```
let sample_user_input = {
    "user": "your_client's_id", // always required on services and pipelines
    "my_file": <the_file as path or blob>
}
let response = await pipe.run(sample_user_input);
console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
```

### More Flexible way to declare a Pipeline
To make your Pipeline more maintainable and easy to use, create a subclass:
```
import { SoffosPipeline, InputConfig } from "soffosai";
import { SoffosServices } from "soffosai-node";


/**
 * Get the filename only out of the given file
 * @private
 * @param {Blob} file - The file that is being converted to text and saved to Soffos db.
 * @returns {string}
 */
function get_filename(file) {
    return file.name.split('.')[0];
}


/**
 * Given a file path, upload the file to Soffos and get its reference document_id in addition to the 
 * converted text.
 * @class
 * @alias _SoffosPipelines.FileIngestPipeline
 */
class FileIngestPipeline extends Pipeline {
    /**
     * @param {string} [name] - The name of this pipeline. Will be used to reference this pipeline
     *  if this pipeline is used as a Service inside another pipeline.
     * @param {Object} [kwargs] - Include other needed properties like apiKey
     */
    constructor(name=null, kwargs={}) {
        const file_converter = new FileConverterService(kwargs);
        file_converter.setInputConfigs(
            "file_converter",
            new InputConfig("user_input", "file"),
            new InputConfig("user_input", "normalize")
        );
        const document_ingest = new DocumentsIngestService(kwargs);
        document_ingest.setInputConfigs(
            "doc_ingest",
            new InputConfig("user_input", "file", get_filename),
            new InputConfig("file_converter", "text")
        );
        return super([file_converter, document_ingest], false, name, kwargs);
    }

    /**
     * Start the pipeline processes.
     */
    async call(user, file, normalize='0', execution_code=null) {
        let payload = {
            "user": user,
            "file": file,
            "normalize": normalize,
            "execution_code": execution_code
        }
        return await this.run(payload);
    }

}

```
When you do this, you can easily reuse your pipeline like this:
```
import { FileIngestPipeline } from "./your_directory/your_file.js";

let pipe = new FileIngestPipeline("myPipe", {apiKey: my_apiKey});

let the_file = <the file as path or blob>;
let result = await pipe.call("client_id", the_file, 0);
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

// on your successive calls:
result = await pipe.call("client2", other_file, 0);
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

### Use Defaults
When you are well versed by the output of the Services, you can create a pipeline without defining all the required arguments of each Service if you know that the previous Services or user_input will provide it. If you know this, just put "default" in the argument. Take note that the user_input or previous Services' outputs should contain the same property / fieldname. There are special cases where the previous Service's output has "document_id" and the current Service requires "document_ids"; this is already handled and can be defaulted. The same with required "document_text" and available "text". Also required "context" and available "text".

Example:
```
import { SoffosPipeline, InputConfig } from "soffosai"; 
import { SoffosServices } from "soffosai-node";


function get_content(value) {
    let combined_text = "";
    for (let item of value) {
        combined_text += item.content;
    }
    return combined_text
}

docSearch = new SoffosServices.DocumentsSearchService({apiKey: my_apiKey});
docSearch.setInpugConfigs(
    "search",
    null,
    null,
    "default"// automatically get this value from the output of previous Services or user_input with
                      // the same property / fieldname.
);

qa = new SoffosServices.QuestionAnsweringService({apiKey: my_apiKey});
qa.setInputConfigs(
    "qa",
    "default",// take the value for this argument from previous Services or from the user_input
    new InputConfig("search", "passage", get_content)
);
const AskFromDocument = new SoffosPipeline(
    [
        docSearch,
        qa
    ],
    true, // this is the **use_defaults** argument. defaults to **false** if not provided. 
         // You can only use the "**default**" keyword on arguments to mean "default this value" if this 
         //is **true**.  if use_defaults is false, it will be taken as literal string "default".
    "myPipe",
    {apiKey: my_apiKey}
);

let input = {
    "user": "client_id", // This is the UUID of your clients. The API will accept any string
    "document_ids": ["1d77babf8164427cad8276ba944e6cbc"],
    "question": "who is Neo?"
}
let result2 = await AskFromDocument.run(input);
console.log(JSON.stringify(result2, null, 2));
```

### Predefined Pipelines
- Soffos will add more predefined pipelines for you. 
You can use them like this:
```
import { SoffosPipelines } from "soffosai";

let pipe = new SoffosPipelines.FileIngestPipeline("myPipe", {apiKey: my_apiKey});
result = await pipe.call("client_id2", the_file)
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

Take note of the difference in names:
- SoffosPipeline is the pipeline Superclass while
- SoffosPipelines is the namespace for all Soffos Pipelines including SoffosPipeline as SoffosPipelines.SoffosPipeline.
